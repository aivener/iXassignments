Plan: 
1. Build the HTML structure
  Regular stuff: html, head, body, etc.
  An input element
  A ordered list for my list

2. Add CSS
  Import Bootstrap
  Style so that my content is in the center of the screen

3. Add Javascript
  Add an id to the input element
  I'm going to add a keypress event handler to the input
  Check if the key that was pressed was "enter"
  Create a new list element
  Put value from text field in that element
  Clear the text field
  Add (append) the list element to the ordered list

4. Challenge: add delete functionality
