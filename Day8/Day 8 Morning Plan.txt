Plan for Day 8 Morning

Product showcase (10 mins)
Explain the final goal and the plan of action. (5 mins)
Explain how the game works + set up. (2 mins)

Round 1. (3 minutes)
   Create a properly formatted HTML skeleton with html, head, and body tags.
   Add an appropriate title to the correct place
   Include Bootstrap CSS (not JS) from a CDN in your head
   Create your own stylesheet called style.css, and link to it in your <head>
   
Round 2. (3 minutes)
   Create a div with class "container". In it, create a div with class "row".
   In the row, create a col-md-6 with an offset of 3 cols (on md screens)
   In the col-md-6, create a div with class "wrapper"
   In your stylesheet, style the wrapper to have a padding of 10px, a background color, and a border
   In the wrapper add an h1 that has text describing the app
   Create an input type text with the class "form-control"
   Beneath your input, create a <ol> with id "list"

<checkpoint> 
Time in: 6 mins + 1 checkpoint

Round 3. (3 minutes)
   In your head, include jQuery from a CDN
   Create a file called script.js and link to it in your HTML
   Add an ID called "todo-input" to your input.form-control
   In your script.js file, properly use $(document).ready()
   
4. (4 minutes)
   Inside the $(document).ready() function, add a keyup event handler to 
   your input (hint: get it by ID using $)
   Log "enter!" to the console *only* when the enter key is pressed (Google is your friend!!)
   
<checkpoint>
Time in: 13 mins + 2 checkpoints

5. (4 minutes)
   Change your Javascript so that instead of logging to the console, you call a function called "addToList" (it doesn't exist yet, we'll create it in a second). Pass "addToList" the value that is inside the input. 
   Hint: your code should now include something like:
      if (/* enter was pressed */) {
         addToList(/* value in the input field */);
      }

6. (4 minutes)
   *Outside* the $(document).ready() function, define a function called "addToList" that takes one parameter called "value".
   With jQuery, create a new "li" element and assign it to a variable called "li"
   Set the html of li to be value
   Add (i.e. append) li to the ol with id "list"
   You should now be able to type something into the input, press enter, and have it show up on the screen below the input

7. (2 minutes)
  Figure out how to clear the input after the element is added

<checkpoint>
Time in: 23 mins + 3 checkpoints ~= 35 mins
Including time for changing computers, expected time is 40 minutes

8. CHALLENGE! (Rest of the time)
  Figure out how to get each list item to delete when clicked.

8A. 
  Come ask questions about how the code works
